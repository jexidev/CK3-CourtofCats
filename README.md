# 🐱 Court of Cats – A CK3 Flavor Mod (WIP)

**Court of Cats** is a modular flavor mod for Crusader Kings III that explores the cultural, political, and mystical roles of cats throughout history. From divine reverence in ancient Egypt to feline court positions and dynastic traditions, this mod aims to bring depth and charm to rulers who walk the path of the paw.

## 🧱 Current Status
This is a **work in progress**. Core systems are being prototyped, including traits, activities, and event chains. No playable content is currently included—this repo serves as the foundation for future development.

## 🐾 Planned Features
- Custom traits and modifiers tied to feline affinity
- A full activity: *Host a Grand Cat Feast*, with branching events and outcomes
- Court positions such as *Royal Mouser* and *Keeper of the Catnip*
- Cultural traditions and dynasty legacies centered around cat reverence
- Lore-based flavor inspired by Egypt, Norse mythology, and medieval superstition
- Optional compatibility with other pet-focused mods

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
Court of Cats is built with modularity and compatibility in mind. It avoids overwriting vanilla files and is designed to complement other flavor mods. The goal is to create a rich, replayable experience that blends historical inspiration with playful storytelling.

## 📁 Folder Structure
The mod is organized for clarity and expansion, with separate folders for traits, activities, events, localization, and more.
